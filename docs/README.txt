Unit2NS is a portable Windows application for finding which namespace a Delphi
unit belongs to. It comes in both 32 and 64 bit versions. There is a different
download for each version. The 32 bit version executable file is named
Unit2NS32.exe and the 64 bit version is Unit2NS64.exe.

There is no installer for this simple program. Simply copy the .exe file to a
folder on your computer or on a USB drive. You can copy this README file to the
same location if you wish.

When it is first run, Unit2NS will write data to a `config` sub-directory of
whichever folder you put it in. For that reason you may prefer to place the
program in its own folder.

DO NOT place Unit2NS in your system's program files folder since the system
will probably prevent it from writing the necessary data files.

To update the program simply download a newer version and overwrite the
executable file in whichever location you installed it. Be careful not to delete
the `config` subdirectory otherwise you will loose your data.

To uninstall the program simply delete the .exe from wherever you installed it.
If you have no further use for the program's data then delete the `config`
sub-directory and all its contents too.

The program is open source and is maintained on GitHub at
