Unit2NS is a portable Windows application for finding which unit scope a given
Delphi unit belongs to.

The program comes in both 32 and 64 bit versions. There is a different download
for each version. The 32 bit version executable file is named `Unit2NS32.exe`
and the 64 bit version is `Unit2NS64.exe`.

There is no installer for this simple program. Simply copy the `.exe` file to a
folder on your computer or external drive. You can copy this read-me file to the
same location if you wish.

When it is first run, Unit2NS will write data to a `config` sub-directory of
whichever folder contains the program. For that reason you may prefer to place
the program in a new folder.

DO NOT place Unit2NS in your system's program files folder because Windows will
probably prevent it from writing the necessary data files.

To update the program simply download a newer version and overwrite the
executable file in whichever location you installed it. Be careful not to delete
the existing `config` subdirectory otherwise you will loose your data.

To uninstall the program simply delete the executable file from wherever you
installed it. If you have no further use for the program's data then delete the
`config` sub-directory and all its contents too.

The program is open source and is maintained on GitHub at
